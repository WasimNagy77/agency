# Agency

AI-powered web development agency - from concept to operation.

## Quick Start for AI Models

**Read these files in order:**
1. `SESSION-LOG.md` - What happened in previous sessions, what's next
2. `STATUS.md` - Current state, progress on each topic
3. `CLAUDE.md` - How to work on this project (extractive brainstorming rules)
4. Check GitHub Project board for tasks

## What This Is

This repository IS the agency - not just planning docs, but the operational foundation that grows with the business.
