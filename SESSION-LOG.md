**Environment:** Claude Code (Terminal)
**Focus:** God Mode Architecture Design

### What Was Done This Session

1. Reviewed saved terminal session from Dec 24
2. Analyzed nail-candy framework vs agency setup
3. Moved framework files from nail-candy to claude-project-template:
   - 6 session self-assessments → learnings/
   - Orchestration docs → orchestration/
   - COMPLETE-SESSION-CONSOLIDATION.md
4. Added SESSION-LOG.md to nail-candy (proper index)
5. Analyzed GitHub MCP (github-full) - found 5 built-in prompts
6. Designed GOD MODE ARCHITECTURE v2.0:
   - Brain (Claude Desktop) + Workers (Claude Code)
   - 9 MCP prompts (5 original + 4 new)
   - 13 department agents with GitHub labels
7. Created new files in claude-project-template:
   - GOD-MODE-ARCHITECTURE.md - Complete workflow design
   - BRAIN.md - Instructions for Claude Desktop as Brain
   - WORKER.md - Standard protocol for workers
8. Added 4 new prompts to GitHub MCP:
   - agency-dashboard - Multi-project status
   - project-intake - New client onboarding
   - worker-delegation - Task assignment
   - daily-standup - Morning status check
9. Updated agents/README.md with GitHub integration
10. Updated ORCHESTRATION-ARCHITECTURE.md to v2.0

### Decisions Made
- GitHub is source of truth
- Extractive brainstorming style (no walls of text)
- UK-based (corrected from Dubai)
- God Mode Architecture:
  - Claude Desktop = Brain (orchestrator)
  - Claude Code = Workers (executors)
  - 13 agents = Specialized departments
  - GitHub MCP prompts = Guided workflows

### What's Next
- Restart Claude Desktop to load new MCP prompts
- Test God Mode workflow:
  - Use `daily-standup` prompt
  - Use `repo-overview` on agency repo
  - Use `project-intake` to create test project
- Then: Brainstorm agency (Issue #1: Brand Identity)
