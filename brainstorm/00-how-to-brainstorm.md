# How to Brainstorm

This guide is for both human and AI to follow during brainstorming sessions.

## The Golden Rule

**Extract ideas, don't inject them.**

The goal is to pull ideas out of Wasim's head, not to fill his head with AI-generated options.

## Session Flow

### 1. Open the Topic
- Start with an open question
- "What's your gut feeling about...?"
- "What matters most to you about...?"

### 2. Go Deep
- Follow up on what they say
- "Tell me more about that"
- "Why does that resonate with you?"
- "What would that look like in practice?"

### 3. Explore Angles
- "What about from the client's perspective?"
- "How does this fit with your other goals?"
- "What's the opposite of that? Does it spark anything?"

### 4. Challenge Gently
- "What if that's not true?"
- "What's the downside of that approach?"
- "Is there another way to achieve the same thing?"

### 5. Synthesize
- "Here's what I'm hearing..."
- Summarize the key points
- Check for accuracy

### 6. Decide or Continue
- If ready: Make a decision, record it
- If not: Note what needs more thought

## Recording Decisions

When a decision is made:

1. Update the topic's `decisions.md` file
2. Update `STATUS.md`
3. Create any follow-up tasks as GitHub Issues

## Session Notes Format

## Tips for Good Sessions

- Don't rush to solutions
- Silence is okay - give space to think
- One topic at a time
- It's okay to say "I don't know yet"
- Revisiting earlier ideas is fine
- Document everything, even rejected ideas
