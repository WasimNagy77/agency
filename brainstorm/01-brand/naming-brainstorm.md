# Agency Naming Brainstorm

**Last updated:** 2025-12-26  
**Status:** In progress - searching for the right name

---

## Brand Positioning (Decided)

- **Brand-first**, not founder-led
- **Premium and professional** leads (over fast/approachable)
- **"Quietly confident"** premium style (like Apple/Aesop, not corporate/institutional)
- AI orchestration system stays invisible to clients
- UK-based agency, .co.uk acceptable but .com preferred

---

## Current Shortlist (~60% confidence)

| Name | Notes | Domain to check |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| **Stonepoint Digital** | Grounded, foundational, precise. Existing "Stonepoint" is UK construction - no overlap. | stonepointdigital.com/.co.uk |
| **Finemark Digital** | Quality craftsmanship, refined, polished. Risk: "FineMark" associated with US banking. | finemarkdigital.com/.co.uk |
